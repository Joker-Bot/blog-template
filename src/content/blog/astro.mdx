**Introduction to Blockchain Technology.** ((In this Article, We will Cover these topics)):-
- What is Blockchain? 
- Blockchain Vs Cryptocurrency.
- Blockchain Types?
- Blockchain Technologies?


## What is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is a transaction record database that is distributed, permissionless, and maintained around the world by a network of nodes.
- Blockchain has a distributed group of nodes that oversee the network.
- Blockchain uses decentralized technologies to provide a peer-to-peer, permissionless, and immutable network to store transactions.
- Some real-life examples:
	 * Bank account statements
	 * A simple record-keeping book
	 * Excel sheets tracking hospital equipment
	 * Records of sale and purchase of raw material

## Blockchain Vs Cryptocurrency.
- Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network
- Cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, created and stored electronically in the blockchain


## Blockchain Types?

Local variables can be used in curly braces to pass attribute values to both HTML elements and components:

```astro title="src/components/DynamicAttributes.astro" "{name}" "${name}"
---
const name = 'Astro'
---

<h1 class={name}>Attribute expressions are supported</h1>

<MyComponent templateLiteralNameAttribute={`MyNameIs${name}`} />
```

:::caution
HTML attributes will be converted to strings, so it is not possible to pass functions and objects to HTML elements.
For example, you can't assign an event handler to an HTML element in an Astro component:

```astro
---
// dont-do-this.astro
function handleClick() {
	console.log('button clicked!')
}
---

<!-- ❌ This doesn't work! ❌ -->
<button onClick={handleClick}>Nothing will happen when you click me!</button>
```

Instead, use a client-side script to add the event handler, like you would in vanilla JavaScript:

```astro
---
// do-this-instead.astro
---

<button id='button'>Click Me</button>
<script>
	function handleClick() {
		console.log('button clicked!')
	}
	document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', handleClick)
</script>
```

Local variables can be used in JSX-like functions to produce dynamically-generated HTML elements:

```astro title="src/components/DynamicHtml.astro" "{item}"
---
const items = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Platypus']
---

<ul>
	{items.map((item) => <li>{item}</li>)}
</ul>
```

Astro can conditionally display HTML using JSX logical operators and ternary expressions.

```astro title="src/components/ConditionalHtml.astro" "visible"
---
const visible = true
---

{visible && <p>Show me!</p>}

{visible ? <p>Show me!</p> : <p>Else show me!</p>}
```



You can also use dynamic tags by setting a variable to an HTML tag name or a component import:

```astro title="src/components/DynamicTags.astro" /Element|(?<!My)Component/
---
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.astro'
const Element = 'div'
const Component = MyComponent
---

<Element>Hello!</Element>
<!-- renders as <div>Hello!</div> -->
<Component />
<!-- renders as <MyComponent /> -->
```

When using dynamic tags:

- **Variable names must be capitalized.** For example, use `Element`, not `element`. Otherwise, Astro will try to render your variable name as a literal HTML tag.

- **Hydration directives are not supported.** When using [`client:*` hydration directives](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components), Astro needs to know which components to bundle for production, and the dynamic tag pattern prevents this from working.



Astro supports using either `<Fragment> </Fragment>` or the shorthand `<> </>`.

Fragments can be useful to avoid wrapper elements when adding [`set:*` directives](/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml), as in the following example:

```astro title="src/components/SetHtml.astro" "Fragment"
---
const htmlString = '<p>Raw HTML content</p>'
---

<Fragment set:html={htmlString} />
```



Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. It was designed to feel familiar to anyone with HTML or JSX experience, but there are a couple of key differences between `.astro` files and JSX.



In Astro, you use the standard `kebab-case` format for all HTML attributes instead of the `camelCase` used in JSX. This even works for `class`, which is not supported by React.

```jsx del={1} ins={2} title="example.astro"
<div className="box" dataValue="3" />
<div class="box" data-value="3" />
```



An Astro component template can render multiple elements with no need to wrap everything in a single `<div>` or `<>`, unlike JavaScript or JSX.

```astro title="src/components/RootElements.astro"
---
// Template with multiple elements
---

<p>No need to wrap elements in a single containing element.</p>
<p>Astro supports multiple root elements in a template.</p>
```



In Astro, you can use standard HTML comments or JavaScript-style comments.

```astro title="example.astro"
---

---

<!-- HTML comment syntax is valid in .astro files -->{/* JS comment syntax is also valid */}
```

:::caution
HTML-style comments will be included in browser DOM, while JS ones will be skipped. To leave TODO messages or other development-only explanations, you may wish to use JavaScript-style comments instead.
