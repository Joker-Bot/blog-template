**Introduction to Blockchain Technology.** ((In this Article, We will Cover these topics)):-
- What is Blockchain? 
- Blockchain Vs Cryptocurrency.
- Blockchain Types?
- Blockchain Technologies?


## What is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is a transaction record database that is distributed, permissionless, and maintained around the world by a network of nodes.
- Blockchain has a distributed group of nodes that oversee the network.
- Blockchain uses decentralized technologies to provide a peer-to-peer, permissionless, and immutable network to store transactions.
- Some real-life examples:
	 * Bank account statements
	 * A simple record-keeping book
	 * Excel sheets tracking hospital equipment
	 * Records of sale and purchase of raw material

## Blockchain Vs Cryptocurrency.
- Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network
- Cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, created and stored electronically in the blockchain

## Blockchain Types?
- Public Blockchain
- Private Blockchain
- Federated/consortium

<span style="color: blue;">Public Blockchain:</span> 
	* A public blockchain is permissionless. Anyone can access the network and read, write, or participate without explicit authorization and permission in 
	  a public blockchain.
	* A public blockchain is decentralized and has no single network-controlled entity
	* Data on a public blockchain is protected because data cannot be changed or manipulated until it has been checked on the blockchain.
	* Well-known examples of a public blockchain are Bitcoin and Ethereum.


<span style="color: blue;">Private Blockchain:</span> 
	* A private blockchain is a permissioned blockchain. Private blockchains function based on access restrictions that limit individuals who may interact 
	in the network. In these blockchains, there are one or more network management organizations, and this contributes to creating dependence on 
	transfers from third parties.
	* Only the individuals involved in a contract will have information about it in a private blockchain, while the others will not be able to access it.
	* Only authorized nodes can read and write the transaction data into a blockchain. One authorized node can be the arbitrator for any dispute.
	* Security can be implemented straightforwardly. It’s easy or computationally less expensive to add a block in a private blockchain.
	* A well-known example of a private blockchain is the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric.
	
<span style="color: blue;">Federated/Consortium Blockchain:</span> 
	* A Consortium or Federated Blockchain is a private, permissioned blockchain – as opposed to a public blockchain – where entities can only become members 	of the network by prior approval or voting.
	* This type is a group-owned system where sole autonomy is removed. Permissions are vested in a group of companies or individuals.
	* Here, more than one central entity is in charge of deciding and providing read, write, and audit access to pre-selected nodes in the blockchain. 
	Only consortium members can make, validate, and review transactions.
	* This type is suitable for use between companies that often have dealings with each other. While these are more secure, they come at the cost 
	of decentralization. However, this suits enterprise use cases and business processes.
	* A well-known example is R3’s Corda Blockchain

## Blockchain Technologies?

Local variables can be used in JSX-like functions to produce dynamically-generated HTML elements:

```astro title="src/components/DynamicHtml.astro" "{item}"
---
const items = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Platypus']
---

<ul>
	{items.map((item) => <li>{item}</li>)}
</ul>
```

Astro can conditionally display HTML using JSX logical operators and ternary expressions.

```astro title="src/components/ConditionalHtml.astro" "visible"
---
const visible = true
---

{visible && <p>Show me!</p>}

{visible ? <p>Show me!</p> : <p>Else show me!</p>}
```



You can also use dynamic tags by setting a variable to an HTML tag name or a component import:

```astro title="src/components/DynamicTags.astro" /Element|(?<!My)Component/
---
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.astro'
const Element = 'div'
const Component = MyComponent
---

<Element>Hello!</Element>
<!-- renders as <div>Hello!</div> -->
<Component />
<!-- renders as <MyComponent /> -->
```

When using dynamic tags:

- **Variable names must be capitalized.** For example, use `Element`, not `element`. Otherwise, Astro will try to render your variable name as a literal HTML tag.

- **Hydration directives are not supported.** When using [`client:*` hydration directives](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components), Astro needs to know which components to bundle for production, and the dynamic tag pattern prevents this from working.



Astro supports using either `<Fragment> </Fragment>` or the shorthand `<> </>`.

Fragments can be useful to avoid wrapper elements when adding [`set:*` directives](/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml), as in the following example:

```astro title="src/components/SetHtml.astro" "Fragment"
---
const htmlString = '<p>Raw HTML content</p>'
---

<Fragment set:html={htmlString} />
```



Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. It was designed to feel familiar to anyone with HTML or JSX experience, but there are a couple of key differences between `.astro` files and JSX.



In Astro, you use the standard `kebab-case` format for all HTML attributes instead of the `camelCase` used in JSX. This even works for `class`, which is not supported by React.

```jsx del={1} ins={2} title="example.astro"
<div className="box" dataValue="3" />
<div class="box" data-value="3" />
```



An Astro component template can render multiple elements with no need to wrap everything in a single `<div>` or `<>`, unlike JavaScript or JSX.

```astro title="src/components/RootElements.astro"
---
// Template with multiple elements
---

<p>No need to wrap elements in a single containing element.</p>
<p>Astro supports multiple root elements in a template.</p>
```



In Astro, you can use standard HTML comments or JavaScript-style comments.

```astro title="example.astro"
---

---

<!-- HTML comment syntax is valid in .astro files -->{/* JS comment syntax is also valid */}
```

:::caution
HTML-style comments will be included in browser DOM, while JS ones will be skipped. To leave TODO messages or other development-only explanations, you may wish to use JavaScript-style comments instead.
