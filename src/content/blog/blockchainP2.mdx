**Blockchain Ecosystem.**((In this Article, We will Cover these topics)):- 
- Merkle Tree & Hashing
- Blocks wallets & Addresses
- Cryptography & Cryptographic Algorithms
- Public & Private key


## Merkle Tree & Hashing
- Merkle Tree:
	* A Merkle tree is a data structure that uses hashing to store and verify the data.
	* In the Merkle tree, each root node contains the hash value of a data block, and non-leaf nodes contain the hash of the child nodes.
	* Merkle trees are used for effective data validation in distributed systems.
	* In a blockchain, each leaf node is the hash of a transaction in the block, and each non-leaf node is a hash of its children.
	* Merkle trees are secure because of hashing. If any data is changed, the Merkle tree structure becomes incorrect.
	* Merkle trees are small in size, making it much easier to maintain and verify the data in the tree.

- Merkle Tree in Blockchain:
	* Merkle trees are used at the base layer of the blockchains to store and verify transaction data.
	* Merkle trees provide data security and integrity by using hash functions.
	* In the case of blockchains, without Merkle trees, the blockchain will become very hard to manage 
	  and use.

The above example is the most common and simple form of a Merkle tree, i.e., Binary Merkle Tree. There are four transactions in a block: TX1, TX2, TX3, and TX4. Here you can see, there is a top hash which is the hash of the entire tree, known as the Root Hash, or the Merkle Root. Each of these is repeatedly hashed, and stored in each leaf node, resulting in Hash 0, 1, 2, and 3. Consecutive pairs of leaf nodes are then summarized in a parent node by hashing Hash0 and Hash1, resulting in Hash01, and separately hashing Hash2 and Hash3, resulting in Hash23. The two hashes (Hash01 and Hash23) are then hashed again to produce the Root Hash or the Merkle Root.

Merkle Root is stored in the block header. The block header is part of the Bitcoin block which gets hash in the process of mining. It contains the hash of the last block, a Nonce, and the Root Hash of all the transactions in the current block in a Merkle Tree. So having the Merkle root in the block header makes the transaction tamper-proof. As this Root Hash includes the hashes of all the transactions within the block, these transactions may result in saving disk space.

- Hashing:
	* Hashing is the process of having an input item of any length converted into an 
	output item of a fixed length.
	* Transactions of different lengths are run through a given hashing algorithm, 
	and all give an output of a fixed length, called a hash.
	* The hash size will depend on the hash function used, but the output using 
	a particular hashing algorithm will be of a specific size.
	* Cryptographic hash functions are one of the most important techniques in the field of cryptography and are used to accomplish many safety 
	goals such as authentication, digital signatures, generation of pseudo numbers, digital steganography, digital time-stamping, etc.
	* Bitcoin uses a cryptographic hashing algorithm- Secure Hashing Algorithm 256, 
	often known as SHA-256.

## Blocks wallets & Addresses
- Blocks

	* A block is the fundamental unit of a Blockchain
	* Every block contains a hash of all the previous blocks.
	* Blocks use Merkle tree to store the hash of all the transactions to create 
	 the hash of block.

 A block is divided into:
	 - <span style="color:orange;">Block header </span>
	 - <span style="color:orange;">Block body</span>

Block header is divided into six components:
	* <span style="color:orange;">Version number</span>
	* <span style="color:orange;">Previous block hash</span>
	* <span style="color:orange;">Merkle tree root hash</span>
	* <span style="color:orange;">nbits</span>
	* <span style="color:orange;">Nonce</span>
	* <span style="color:orange;">Timestamp</span>

	Block body contains all the transactions:

- Wallet:
	* A Blockchain wallet is a software program that enables users to buy, sell, 
	and monitor the balance of their digital assets and record the transactions done 
	using the wallet address.
	* A wallet stores private and public keys for a user. As the name suggests, 
	the public key is shared and works as the address while the private key is kept private.
	* Public and private keys are used to encrypt and decrypt transactions so only 
	the intended recipient can know the transaction data.
	* A Blockchain wallet offers all the features available for safe and 
	secure transactions and exchanges of funds between various parties.

	There are three types of cryptocurrency wallets :
	* <span style="color:orange;">Software Wallets: </span>  like Metamask which runs on a machine.
	* <span style="color:orange;">Hardware Wallets: </span>  are storage devices on 
	which users can store their keys.
	* <span style="color:orange;">Paper Wallets: </span> are just writing down your 
	public and private key on a paper and keeping it someplace safe.

- Software Wallet:
	* Desktop Wallet
		- Can be downloaded on a PC or a laptop
		- Desktop wallets are safe if your system is protected against virus attacks
	* Online Wallet
		- Run on cloud
		- You can access them from any device through a web browser
	* Mobile Wallet
 		- Available as a mobile app
		 Easier and fast funds transfer

- Hardware Wallets:
	* Store private keys of users on a hardware device like USB or pendrive.
	* Are compatible with various web interfaces.
	* Are the safest wallet options available.

- Paper Wallets:
	* Generally, work with software wallets for buying and selling of funds.
	* Currencies are transferred from software wallets to the public address on paper.

There are two types of wallets used in Blockchain:
	* <span style="color:orange;"> Hot Wallet </span>
	* <span style="color:orange;"> Cold Wallet </span>

Hot Wallet:
* Are digital cryptocurrency wallets
* Are online wallets through which it is easy to quickly transfer cryptocurrencies.
* Private keys in the hot wallet are stored in the cloud for a quicker transfer.
* Can be easily accessible 24/7 online and can be accessed from a laptop or mobile, 
 but if compromised, there is a chance of unrecoverable theft.
* Hot Wallet are free of charge.
* Online wallet, Desktop wallet and Mobile wallet consider Hot Wallet

<span style="color:green;"> Examples </span>: Coinbase and Blockchain.info

Cold Wallet:
* Are physical devices that store cryptos inside of them.
* Are offline digital wallets where the transfers are digitally signed and then electronically 
  disclosed.
* Private keys are kept in independent hardware that is not connected to internet or the 
  cloud, but stored on paper document.
* Transaction approach helps to shield the wallet from unauthorized entry.
* Cold wallets are expensive in comparison to hot wallets.
* Hardware wallet and Paper wallet consider Cold Wallet.

<span style="color:green;"> Examples </span>: Trezor and Ledger

- Address:
* A Blockchain address is used to identify a user on the blockchain network. It is a special 
 sequence of numbers, letters, and functions.
* It applies to a particular network destination where it is possible to transfer the 
 cryptocurrency.
* An address is a placeholder to accept and send blockchain transactions.
* Pay-to-IP had been abandoned in Bitcoin. Pay-to-Public Key Hash became the new standard 
 format for Bitcoin addresses.
* Public keys are generally used to create an address for a user.
*  The steps to create an address include:
	- Hashing of public key using SHA 256
	- Re-hashing using RIPEMD-160
	- Adding “00” prefix
	- Adding checksum bytes at the end
	- Encode the result with base58 encoding

<span style="color:red;">NOTE : </span>

1- Address is a representation of a public key.

2- If you paste an address in your Bitcoin wallet, it scans the prefix and calculates the checksum.

3- It refuses the address if it doesn’t fit. It is difficult to transfer funds to an incorrect address because of a trying mistake

## Cryptography & Cryptographic Algorithms
* Cryptography is a technique to secure data using computer software.
* It works such that users can encrypt and decrypt the transaction so that the data is not 
 leaked to third party.
* It is derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations.
* Cryptographic Algorithms usually involves three things:
	- Cryptographic Key Generation
	- Digital Signing
	- Verification to Protect Privacy

<span style="color:red;">NOTE : </span> In the case of blockchain, cryptography is used to encrypt transaction data to maintain the confidentiality and authenticity of transaction data.


## Public & Private key
- Public Key:
* Public key is one of the two keys generated using asymmetric encryption protocols used in blockchain technology.
* Public key which also acts as the address of an account on the blockchain is a fixed-length alphanumeric number. 
  Bitcoin’s public key is 256 bits long.
* Public key is made using a private key and then broadcasted to the public.
* Public key encryption works such that anyone can encrypt using the public key but only the 
 owner of corresponding private key decrypts the message.
* A shorter representative version of the public key is the address that is used for receiving funds

- Private Key:
* A user has a public address and a private key to send and receive transactions. Users can maker transactions to 
  the public address.
 * Private key is an alphanumeric string, it is critical to keep the key safe for the safety of crypto tokens.
* Digital wallets are used to store the private keys.
* Transactions use digital signatures to verify the sender. A valid digital signature confirms that the 
  transaction comes from a particular user. Any change in the translation data invalidates the signature.
* Private keys can be stored differently, some method of storage are:
	
	<span style="color:orange;"> 1- Paper wallets </span>

	<span style="color:orange;"> 2- Hardware wallets </span>

	<span style="color:orange;"> 3- Cold storage like pen-drives </span>

	<span style="color:orange;"> 4- Offline software wallet. </span>

* There are Hot wallets connected to internet which can be used to store the keys online
