## Data Locations - Storage, Memory, and Calldata
  Data locations in solidity describe how and where data is kept or accessible on the Ethereum blockchain
Variables are declared as either storage, memory, or calldata to explicitly specify the location of the data.

Storage:
		○ Data is stored in persistent storage in the blockchains.
		○ Used for state variables. Those variables that are declared outside of functions are known as state       variables.
		○ State variables are stored in contract storage and retain their values between function calls and         transactions.

```astro
	pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
	
	contract StorageExample {
	    uint256 public storedData; 
	
	    function setStoredData(uint256 newValue) public {
	        storedData = newValue;
	    }
	
	    function getStoredData() public view returns (uint256) {
	        return storedData;
	    }
	}
```
	Explanation
	
	1- we create storedData the state variable stored in contract storage. 
	2- Changes made in storedData are permanent and affected by the blockchain state between function     
      calls and transactions. 
	3- we created a getter and setter to set the value of storedData the variable.

Memory:

		○ Variable is in memory and it exists while a function is being called, they are transitory and will       disappear when the function has completed running.
		○ Used for local variables, function arguments, and return values.

```astro
	pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
	
	contract MemoryExample {
	    function mathoperation(uint256 value1, uint256 value2) public pure returns (uint256) {
	        uint256 answer;
	        answer = a + b; // Temporary value stored in memory
	        return answer;
	    }
	}
```
Explanation

	1- we create the function name the mathoperation that takes two variable value1 and value2 and        add them and store them in the variable answer.
	2- The answer variable is stored in memory within the mathoperation function. 

Calldata:
		○ Read-only data location is used for function arguments.
		○ Immutable data location.
		○ Accessing data from calldata is cheaper than storage.
```astro
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract CalldataExample {
    function joinTwoStrings(string calldata string1, string calldata string2) public pure returns (string memory) {
        bytes memory result = bytes(string1);             // Calldata data used for reading
        result = abi.encodePacked(result, bytes(string2));         // Concatenate strings in memory
        return string(result);
    }
}

```
Explanation

1- we create the joinTwoString function that takes two arguments string1 and string2 having     
    calldata .
2- The calldata is used for input data that is read-only and immutable. 
3- The strings are concatenated in memory before returning the result

## Enum:
enums stand for Enumerable. 
	• Enums are user-defined data types that restrict the variable to have only one of the 
    predefined values.
	• They are useful to model choice and keep track of state.
	• Enums can be declared outside of a contract.

Syntax
```astro
enum  enum-name {
  value1,
  value2,
  ...
}

```
```astro
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Enum {
    // Enum representing shipping status
    enum Status {
        Pending,
        Shipped,
        Accepted,
        Rejected,
        Canceled
    }

    // Default value is the first element listed in
    // definition of the type, in this case "Pending"
    Status public status;

    // Returns uint
    // Pending  - 0
    // Shipped  - 1
    // Accepted - 2
    // Rejected - 3
    // Canceled - 4
    function get() public view returns (Status) {
        return status;
    }

    // Update status by passing uint into input
    function set(Status _status) public {
        status = _status;
    }

    // You can update to a specific enum like this
    function cancel() public {
        status = Status.Canceled;
    }

    // delete resets the enum to its first value, 0
    function reset() public {
        delete status;
    }
}

```


## Structs :
	• They are useful for grouping together related data.
	• Structs can be declared outside of a contract and imported in another contract.
  • Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the   
    following attributes about each book
          - Title
		      - Author
		      - Subject
		      - Book ID

Syntax
```astro
struct struct_name { 
   type1 type_name_1;
   type2 type_name_2;
   type3 type_name_3;
}

```

<span style="color:green;"> Example: </span>

```astro
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract test {
   struct Book { 
      string title;
      string author;
      uint book_id;
   }
   Book book;
function setBook() public {
      book = Book('Learn Java', 'TP', 1);
   }
   function getBookId() public view returns (uint) {
      return book.book_id;
   }
}

```
