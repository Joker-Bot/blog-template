**In this Article, We will explain these topics:-**

- Data Locations - Storage, Memory, and Calldata
- Enum
- Structs
- Error
- Events
- Constructor

## Data Locations - Storage, Memory, and Calldata
  Data locations in solidity describe how and where data is kept or accessible on the Ethereum blockchain
Variables are declared as either storage, memory, or calldata to explicitly specify the location of the data.

Storage:
	- Data is stored in persistent storage in the blockchains.
	- Used for state variables. Those variables that are declared outside of functions are 
	   known as state variables.
	- State variables are stored in contract storage and retain their values between function 
	   calls and transactions.



```astro
	pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
	
	contract StorageExample {
	    uint256 public storedData; 
	
	    function setStoredData(uint256 newValue) public {
	        storedData = newValue;
	    }
	
	    function getStoredData() public view returns (uint256) {
	        return storedData;
	    }
	}
```


<span style="color:green;"> Explanation </span> 
- we create storedData the state variable stored in contract storage. 

- Changes made in storedData are permanent and affected by the blockchain state between function 
   calls and transactions. 

- we created a getter and setter to set the value of storedData the variable.


Memory:
	- Variable is in memory and it exists while a function is being called, they are
           transitory and will disappear when the function has completed running.
	- Used for local variables, function arguments, and return values.


```astro
	pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
	
	contract MemoryExample {
	    function mathoperation(uint256 value1, uint256 value2) public pure returns (uint256) {
	        uint256 answer;
	        answer = a + b; // Temporary value stored in memory
	        return answer;
	    }
	}
```


<span style="color:green;"> Explanation </span> 

- we create the function name the mathoperation that takes two variable value1 and value2 and add 
   them and store them in the variable answer.

- The answer variable is stored in memory within the mathoperation function. 



Calldata:
	
	- Read-only data location is used for function arguments.
	- Immutable data location.
	- Accessing data from calldata is cheaper than storage.


```astro
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract CalldataExample {
    function joinTwoStrings(string calldata string1, string calldata string2) public pure returns (string memory) {
        bytes memory result = bytes(string1);             // Calldata data used for reading
        result = abi.encodePacked(result, bytes(string2));         // Concatenate strings in memory
        return string(result);
    }
}
```


<span style="color:green;"> Explanation </span> 

- we create the joinTwoString function that takes two arguments string1 and string2 having 
   calldata.

- The calldata is used for input data that is read-only and immutable. 

- The strings are concatenated in memory before returning the result



## Enum:
enums stand for Enumerable. 
	- Enums are user-defined data types that restrict the variable to have only one of the 
predefined values.

	- They are useful to model choice and keep track of state.

	- Enums can be declared outside of a contract.


<span style="color:Orange;"> Syntax </span> 

```astro
enum  enum-name {
  value1,
  value2,
  ...
}

```

<span style="color:green;">  Example </span>

```astro
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Enum {
    // Enum representing shipping status
    enum Status {
        Pending,
        Shipped,
        Accepted,
        Rejected,
        Canceled
    }

    // Default value is the first element listed in
    // definition of the type, in this case "Pending"
    Status public status;

    // Returns uint
    // Pending  - 0
    // Shipped  - 1
    // Accepted - 2
    // Rejected - 3
    // Canceled - 4
    function get() public view returns (Status) {
        return status;
    }

    // Update status by passing uint into input
    function set(Status _status) public {
        status = _status;
    }

    // You can update to a specific enum like this
    function cancel() public {
        status = Status.Canceled;
    }

    // delete resets the enum to its first value, 0
    function reset() public {
        delete status;
    }
}

```



## Structs :
	• They are useful for grouping together related data.
	• Structs can be declared outside of a contract and imported in another contract.
  • Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the   
    following attributes about each book
          - Title
	  - Author
	  - Subject
	  - Book ID

<span style="color:Orange;"> Syntax </span> 
```astro
struct struct_name { 
   type1 type_name_1;
   type2 type_name_2;
   type3 type_name_3;
}

```

<span style="color:green;"> Example: </span>

```astro
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract test {
   struct Book { 
      string title;
      string author;
      uint book_id;
   }
   Book book;
function setBook() public {
      book = Book('Learn Java', 'TP', 1);
   }
   function getBookId() public view returns (uint) {
      return book.book_id;
   }
}

```


## Error
An error will undo all changes made to the state during a transaction.
You can throw an error by calling require, revert or assert.

- require ( bool condition, string memory message): is used to validate inputs and conditions before execution. It provides an option to provide a custom message
- revert ( string memory reason): is similar to require.This method aborts the execution and revert any changes done to the state. It provides an option to provide a custom message.
- assert (bool condition): is used to check for code that should never be false. This method is to be used for internal errors.

<span style="color:green;">  Example </span> 

```astro
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Error {
    function testRequire(uint256 _i) public pure {
        // Require should be used to validate conditions such as:
        // - inputs
        // - conditions before execution
        // - return values from calls to other functions
        require(_i > 10, "Input must be greater than 10");
    }

    function testRevert(uint256 _i) public pure {
        // Revert is useful when the condition to check is complex.
        // This code does the exact same thing as the example above
        if (_i <= 10) {
            revert("Input must be greater than 10");
        }
    }

    uint256 public num;

    function testAssert() public view {
        // Assert should only be used to test for internal errors,
        // and to check invariants.

        // Here we assert that num is always equal to 0
        // since it is impossible to update the value of num
        assert(num == 0);
    }

    // custom error
    error InsufficientBalance(uint256 balance, uint256 withdrawAmount);

    function testCustomError(uint256 _withdrawAmount) public view {
        uint256 bal = address(this).balance;
        if (bal < _withdrawAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance({
                balance: bal,
                withdrawAmount: _withdrawAmount
            });
        }
    }
}

```
## Events
 - Are a way to log and notify external entities (such as user interfaces or other smart contracts) about specific occurrences within a smart contract
 - It stores the arguments passed in transaction logs. These logs are stored on the blockchain and are accessible using address of the contract till the contract is present on    
   the blockchain.
 - An event generated is not accessible from within contracts, not even the one which have created and emitted them.

<span style="color:Orange;"> Syntax </span> 

```astro
//Declare an Event
event Deposit(address indexed _from, bytes32 indexed _id, uint _value);
//Emit an event
emit Deposit(msg.sender, _id, msg.value);
```

<span style="color:green;"> Example: </span>
```astro
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Event {
    // Event declaration
    // Up to 3 parameters can be indexed.
    // Indexed parameters helps you filter the logs by the indexed parameter
    event Log(address indexed sender, string message);
    event AnotherLog();

    function test() public {
        emit Log(msg.sender, "Hello World!");
        emit Log(msg.sender, "Hello EVM!");
        emit AnotherLog();
    }
}
```


## Constructor
It is an optional function and is used to initialize state variables of a contract. 
Following are the key characteristics of a constructor:
	- A contract can have only one constructor.
	- A constructor code is executed once when a contract is created and it is used to 
           initialize contract state.
	- A constructor can be either public or internal.
	- In case, no constructor is defined, a default constructor is present in the contract.

<span style="color:Orange;"> Syntax </span>

```astro
	contract Test {
   constructor() public {}
}
```

<span style="color:green;"> Example: </span>
```astro
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

// Base contract X
contract X {
    string public name;

    constructor(string memory _name) {
        name = _name;
    }
}

// Base contract Y
contract Y {
    string public text;

    constructor(string memory _text) {
        text = _text;
    }
}

// There are 2 ways to initialize parent contract with parameters.

// Pass the parameters here in the inheritance list.

contract B is X("Input to X"), Y("Input to Y") {}

contract C is X, Y {
    // Pass the parameters here in the constructor,
    // similar to function modifiers.
    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _text) X(_name) Y(_text) {}
}

// Parent constructors are always called in the order of inheritance
// regardless of the order of parent contracts listed in the
// constructor of the child contract.

// Order of constructors called:
// 1. X
// 2. Y
// 3. D
contract D is X, Y {
    constructor() X("X was called") Y("Y was called") {}
}

// Order of constructors called:
// 1. X
// 2. Y
// 3. E
contract E is X, Y {
    constructor() Y("Y was called") X("X was called") {}
}

```
